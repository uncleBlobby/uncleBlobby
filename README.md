- 👋 Hi, I’m @uncleBlobby
- 👀 I’m interested in the four-day work week, chicken burgers, and hiking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, SFML, Python, Ursina-Engine, Javascript/HTML/CSS, Node
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on your new rap album.
- 📫 Send me an email!

This year I have spent a good amount of time learning the art of programming, starting with HTML / CSS and Javascript through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  While I haven't yet completed it, I have made a good amount of progress and have come along way.

I've also spent a lot of time over the past months experimenting with web development technology, mostly through self-guided means (with the help of some good friends, of course).  From the backend with ExpressJS and NextJS to frontend React and Vue, I have dipped my toes in just about everywhere.

Throughout the spring and summer I worked on implementing my own [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) and competed in the 2021 Fall League.  In terms of concrete results, that was probably the first real "peak" of my development journey.  Watching my entry compete with others from across the globe was a real satisfying experience -- even though I didn't wind up anywhere near the top of the standings.  To anyone looking for a fun way to practice their language of choice, I would highly recommend giving Batttlesnake a try.

To wind up the year, I enrolled in a programming course at the local university and have spent the last 4 months absorbing as much C++ as possible.  I am now growing more and more comfortable with statically-typed, compiled code -- whereas initially in my journey I couldn't imagine why ANYONE would dream of using anything but javascript. :P

All that being said -- I have been a bit shy of python.  I'm not sure why?  But through a stroke of luck I've come upon an opportunity now to spend the winter working with the language on a fun project through the university.  I've decided to use the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) as an opportunity to practice the syntax and become more familiar with the ins-and-outs of Python!

Wish me luck!
